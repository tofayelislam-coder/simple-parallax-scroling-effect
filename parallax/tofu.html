    <h2>A DAY IN THE LIFE OF A WEB DEVELOPER</h2><hr>
    <p>
      The majority of modern-day businesses cannot expect to stay competitive without a strong online presence. Naturally, then, most businesses employ or contract web developers – the people tasked with building functional, attractive, and user-friendly online platforms. <br>

Before we jump into a day in the life of a web developer – do you know the main responsibilities of this career?<br>

 

 <b> A WEB DEVELOPER PERFORMS TASKS SUCH AS…</b><br>

<ol>
  <li >Building websites using technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This includes the layout of websites, as well as frameworks used to deliver the content that will be displayed on the site.</li>

  <li>Modifying and updating websites according to a company or client’s specifications.</li><br>

  
</ol><br><hr>
Collaborating with other colleagues, such as content creators, copywriters, graphic designers, marketing managers, and IT staff.
Testing websites and troubleshooting any problems as soon as they are identified.
Web developers work either within companies or at specific web design agencies, or as freelancers. Job roles may therefore vary according to this, and also according to the size of the company or agency. For example, in smaller companies, web developers will frequently interact with other team members and may take on multiple roles. In larger companies, the web developer may focus on only a few more specialised roles.

It’s important to note that your roles also differ depending on whether you’re a front-end developer or a back-end developer.

In simple terms, front-end developers are responsible for producing the aspects of the website that users see and interact with, while back-end developers are tasked with developing the underlying platforms that drive the front-end. Click here for a full description of the differences between front-end and back-end web development. <br>

 

  <b> WHAT DOES A TYPICAL DAY LOOK LIKE FOR A FRONT-END WEB DEVELOPER?</b><br>
Your work schedule is typically far from routine, because you’ll often be solving problems as they arise. Schedules and deadlines can however apply to big projects. Here is an example of a day in the life of a front-end web developer:

    <h4>The Feeling of Passion in Web Development</h4>
    <p>Are you a web developer who doesn’t write code outside of work hours? One of those web developers who don’t have an active Github account and loads of side projects? Have you ever felt less valuable than other developers due to not staying after hours or weekends for your job? Less valuable because you haven’t tried all the latest and greatest frameworks/languages?

      And finally, have you ever been told or made to feel that you “lack passion” due to the above mentioned points? Then this post is for you. Let’s chat about the feeling of passion in web development.
      
      
      The Epiphany
      I was having a conversation with a friend of mine the other day, and had an epiphany about this career. Web development is one of the only careers where “passion” can be used as a metric for hiring or determining an employee’s value. The feeling of passion. It reminded me of some food for thought I’ve come across while reading, The Art of Loving:
      
      First of all, the practice of an art requires discipline. I shall never be good at anything if I do not do it in a disciplined way; anything I do only if “I am in the mood” may be a nice or amusing hobby, but I shall never become a master in that art.
      
      Why bring up a book about love when I’m talking about passion in web development? Passion and love are related words, in some cases, even synonyms. The first definition I found for passion confirmed it as, “any powerful or compelling emotion or feeling, as love or hate.”

      And there’s nothing wrong with passion when it comes to work. I just want to get that out there. If you’re passionate about your work, then that’s great. The problem I see though, is when we determine skill sets or personalities based on said passion. I’ve seen one too many job postings summoning rock stars and ninjas with sizeable portfolios or side projects.

What happens to the web developers whose work is company owned? What happens to those who arrive at work just to do their job, and then go home once it’s time to go home? Should developers feel guilty for not pursuing code outside of work hours?

Let’s return to those questions in a minute and talk about passion a bit more. <br><hr>

 <b> What’s wrong with passion?</b><br><br>

The thing with passion is it’s temporary. It’s a feeling. Just like love, feelings come and go. Here’s another snippet from The Art of Loving:

“To love somebody is not just a strong feeling – it is a decision, it is a judgement, it is a promise.

If love were only a feeling, there would be no basis for the promise to love each other forever.

A feeling comes and it may go. How can I judge that it will stay forever, when my act does not involve judgement and decision.”

This might sound silly, taking quotes about love and relationships, and comparing them to work. But is it? We spend about a third of our lives working. For an 8 hour work day with commute, let’s assume 12 hours a day, we’re spending 50% of our day at work. Assuming we’re getting 8 hours of sleep, that’s another 33% percent of our day, leaving us with about 17% of the day for whatever.In other words, aside from sleep, work is what takes up most of our lives, and whether we like it or not, it’s a commitment. Same as the way a relationship is a commitment, work is a commitment. Work is a relationship. It’s something you put effort into regardless of whether you have a passion for it at all times.

My point is that books like “The Art of Loving” exist because there are so many relationships that fail due to the loss of passion. There’s this myth that love is this magic that just happens, effortlessly and never wanes. But the truth is, as the first quote I wrote earlier in this article, that love or a relationship is something that takes discipline to master.
